# didyakno
Didyakno fun fact generator

This was a project that I have thought of after I have passed my AWS Cloud Practictioner Exam and received my certificate. I found the AWS Cloud Resume challenge on reddit, and based Didyakno off that with my own spin.

The fun facts generated are stored in DynamoDB and were generated by Microsoft Copilot.

How everything is set up and configured. I will presume that you will be learning just the way I am for the first time and will also be googling a lot of it.

AWS S3:
Simple Storage Service. Created two buckets, one for domain(didyakno.com) and one for subdomain(www.didyakno.com). AWS calls them "buckets" and these buckets are stored on AWS's servers throughout the world. This is important because each bucket is unique and therefore the naming is important.

I also uploaded a CSV file temporarily to one of the buckets for the purpose of bulk importing into DynamoDB.

AWS CloudFront:
Content Delivery Network. Also required for HTTPS. The Cloudfront distribution will store content statically, and if unavailable or outdated, will pull from your origin (in my case, the s3 bucket).
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GettingStarted.SimpleDistribution.html

AWS Route53:
DNS Registrar and DNS services. I purchased didyakno.com and went through the steps of registering my domain name with Amazon and it was very smooth. Once domain name was purchased, setting up the hosted zone with A records (redirects traffic) was not too difficult.

AWS API Gateway:
Fully managed service, allows you to create, edit, delete APIs. Acts as the front-end to your Lambda functions. Pretty straight forward to set-up following resources on google. Until you get to CORS. More on this later.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-cors.html

AWS Lambda:
Serverless Compute. With the assistance of Microsoft Copilot and AWS documentation, I created two lambda functions. One to generate the fun fact and increment the fun fact counter. The second to retrieve the fun fact counter.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_Cors.html

AWS DynamoDB:
Serverless database. Used bulk import from S3. Double-checked that the import was under the free tier. I had "fun" debugging why my CSV wasn't being loaded. This involved setting up logging with Cloudwatch.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-dynamo-db.html#http-api-dynamo-db-create-table

Tertiary services used:
-AWS Cloudwatch for debugging
-AWS Certificate Manager for managing certificates used for SSL/TLS.

CORS:
After reading and seeing examples of how CORS is set up, it seemed easy enough. You had to make sure that the CORS policy is enabled and contained the relevant Access Controls that was needed. In my case, I needed Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Origin, and Access-Control-Allow-Headers.
I also thought it was easy enough to duplicate across API Gateway, and Lambda Code. But after seeing it not work, I found resource stating that the s3 bucket needed a CORS policy as well. Eventually when I got around to Cloudfront, there as well. After mess with wildcard *, copying and pasting meticulously, and other failed attempts, the one thing that finally got it all to work was making sure the methods matched 1:1 across the board. That means, GET, and OPTIONS, were needed. As well as removing the dang "/" at the end of my URL in the Lambda code. So. Frustrating. But you got this.

Costs:
Domain Name registration (didyakno.com)
Web Application Firewall (Protection for your webserver)
AWS Route53 Hosted Zone (DNS routing)

Final thoughts:
Though I had learned a lot through the cloud practictioner coursework, it will not prepare you for the headaches you would run into realworld with deploying your own website and getting everything up and running. (CORS, I'm looking at you!)
Through googling, reading AWS documentation, and asking Microsoft Copilot, I have learned how to set up and configure all of the microservices being used on top of minimizing costs by keeping things mostly in the free tier.
